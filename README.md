<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Doctor appointment (Backend) <a id="about-project"></a>

[DoctorsAPPointments] This is an API rails backend app that allows users to sign up and login into the app allows user to book an appointment with available doctors or create new doctors

Backend is implement as API-only. The front end is implemented utilizing the React framework.

-  The backend Rails app is implemented as API-only. The application starts by fetching the `users` method on the backend, if the backend is available then the user will login by making a query to `users/new_session`.

-  The doctor controller provides an `index` method to get all the data for doctors, and a `show` method to get details about a specific doctor. The `destroy` method deactivates the doctor when the user sends a delete query by clicking on delete.

-  The reservation controller also provides `index` methods. Index is used to get a list of all reservations made.
